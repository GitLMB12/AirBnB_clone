Airbnb Clone - README
Project Description
The Airbnb Clone project is a part of the ALX software engineering program. It aims to replicate some of the functionalities of the popular accommodation rental platform Airbnb. The project focuses on creating a command-line interface (CLI) for managing properties, users, bookings, and other related tasks.

Command Interpreter Description
The command interpreter is a CLI tool designed to interact with the Airbnb Clone application. It provides a set of commands to perform various actions such as creating and managing users, properties, bookings, and more. The command interpreter is built using Python and utilizes object-oriented programming principles for modularity and extensibility.

How to Start the Command Interpreter
To start the command interpreter, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory.
Run the command ./console.py in your terminal.
How to Use the Command Interpreter
Once the command interpreter is running, you can use the following commands:

create <class>: Create a new instance of the specified class (e.g., create User).
show <class> <id>: Display information about the specified instance (e.g., show User 1).
destroy <class> <id>: Delete the specified instance (e.g., destroy User 1).
all <class>: Display all instances of the specified class (e.g., all User).
update <class> <id> <attribute> <value>: Update the specified attribute of the instance (e.g., update User 1 name "John Doe").
